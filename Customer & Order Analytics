#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

-How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6;

-How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND product="iPhone";

-Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
ON feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

-Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT product,price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

-What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS TotalRev, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product 
ORDER BY TotalRev ASC;

-Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS TotalRev, product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location="548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;

-How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum),avg(quantity*price) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS cust
ON feb.OrderID=cust.order_id
WHERE feb.quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6;
